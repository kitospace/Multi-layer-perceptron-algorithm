Overview
This work is structured into three parts, each focusing on different aspects of data analysis and visualization. The file is named mlp.ipynb.

Part 1:
Implement perceptron learning algorithm for classifying a linearly separable dataset in 2D. Note that you have to create such a dataset with at least 1000 data points. Plot the dataset before and after training (with the classifier). Discuss your observations with respect to number of iterations required for perfect classification (k) by varying the level of separability (γ from the class discussions) in the dataset. (Hint: compute the average value of k for each level of γ, and do this for about 5 values of γ. Observe if you can relate to the result discussed in class)
